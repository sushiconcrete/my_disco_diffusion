- This is only for testing use, you may adjust it to develop your own parameters. 
- After several tests, this is the most effient model I got to generate video. It optimize: 
  - Computational time consumend 
  - Good quility of the final video such as: f
  1.following the prompts
  2.a fair smothness 
  3.enough cuts to keep some of the variations.

Keep in mind that the time consumend is also related to the video length and the desired resolution.
