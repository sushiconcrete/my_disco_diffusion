This model is provided for testing purposes, and you may fine-tune its parameters to suit your specific needs. After extensive testing, it has proven to be the most efficient model for video generation in terms of:

Minimizing computational time
Ensuring high-quality final output, including adherence to prompts, smooth transitions, and sufficient variation through editing cuts
Please note that the time consumed by this model also depends on the length of the video and the desired resolution. Always consider these factors when optimizing for efficiency and quality.
